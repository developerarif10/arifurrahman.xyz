The material shading was key; a subsurface scattering effect was applied to the coral material to give it a translucent, waxy appearance similar to real marine life or high-end plastic art.",

The \"Coral Spiral\" stands as a testament to the beauty of mathematical forms in nature, translated through a modern digital lens. This project advanced my skills in procedural modeling and material design."
